        This article is about the men's football club based in England. For the women's team, see Arsenal W.F.C. For other teams called Arsenal, see Arsenal (disambiguation) § Association football.

    <p>
        Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in Islington, London, England. Arsenal plays in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. The club has won 13 league titles (including one unbeaten title), a record 14 FA Cups, two League Cups, 16 FA Community Shields, the League Centenary Trophy, one European Cup Winners' Cup, and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.
    </p>
    <p>
        Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join the Football League in 1893, and they reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division,<sup>[6]</sup> and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history.<sup>[7]</sup> In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 1970–71, they won their first League and FA Cup Double. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position.<sup>[8]</sup> Between 1998 and 2017, Arsenal qualified for the UEFA Champions League for 19 straight seasons,<sup>[9]</sup> and in the last seven years have won a further four FA Cups.<sup>[10]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        Herbert Chapman, who changed the fortunes of Arsenal forever, won the club its first silverware, and his legacy led the club to dominate the 1930s decade; Chapman, however, died of pneumonia in 1934, aged 55. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers;<sup>[11]</sup> he also added the white sleeves and brighter red to the club's jersey.<sup>[12]</sup> Arsène Wenger is the longest-serving manager and won the most trophies. He won a record seven FA Cups, and his title-winning team set an English record for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004,<sup>[13]</sup> receiving the nickname The Invincibles.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1886, munitions workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, after the destruction of their South London stadium by suffragettes, the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close neighbours of Tottenham Hotspur, and creating the North London derby. In 2006, they moved to the nearby Emirates Stadium. With an annual revenue of €388m in the 19–20 season,<sup>[14]</sup> Arsenal was estimated to be worth US$2.68 billion by Forbes, making it the world's seventh most valuable club,<sup>[15]</sup> while it is one of the most followed on social media.<sup>[16]</sup> The motto of the club has long been Victoria Concordia Crescit, Latin for "Victory Through Harmony".

    <h3>1886–1919: Changing names</h3>

    <p>
        In October 1886, Scotsman David Danskin and fifteen fellow munitions workers in Woolwich formed Dial Square Football Club, named after a workshop at the heart of the Royal Arsenal complex. Each member contributed sixpence and Danskin also added three shillings to help form the club.<sup>[4][a]</sup> Dial Square played their first match on 11 December 1886 against Eastern Wanderers and won 6–0.<sup>[20]</sup> The club renamed to Royal Arsenal a month later,<sup>[21][19]</sup> and its first home was Plumstead Common,<sup>[19]</sup> though they spent most of their time playing at the Manor Ground. Their first trophies were the Kent Senior Cup and London Charity Cup in 1889–90 and the London Senior Cup in 1890–91; these were the only county association trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London.<sup>[22][23]</sup> In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional.<sup>[24]</sup>

    </p>
    <p>
        Royal Arsenal renamed for a second time upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893. They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with The Football League when the club ascended later that year.<sup>[25][26]: 5–21 </sup> Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of The Football League, starting out in the Second Division and reaching the First Division in 1904. Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910.<sup>[27][26]: 112–149 </sup> Businessmen Henry Norris and William Hall became involved in the club, and sought to move them elsewhere.<sup>[28][26]: 22–42 </sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, the grandstand of Woolwich Arsenal's Plumstead stadium was burnt down by the suffragettes, as part of their nationwide bombing and arson campaign for women's suffrage.<sup>[29][30]</sup> The attack cost £1,000 in damages (around £120,000 today), and so the same year the club moved across the river to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury.<sup>[29][31][32]</sup> In 1919, The Football League controversially voted to promote The Arsenal, instead of relegated local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, into the newly enlarged First Division, despite only finishing fifth in the Second Division's last pre-war season of 1914–15. Later that year, The Arsenal started dropping "The" in official documents, gradually shifting its name for the final time towards Arsenal, as it is generally known today.<sup>[33]</sup>

    <h3>1919–1953: Bank of England club</h3>
    <p>
        With a new home and First Division football, attendances were more than double those at the Manor Ground, and Arsenal's budget grew rapidly.<sup>[34][35]</sup> Their location and record-breaking salary offer lured star Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman in 1925.<sup>[36][37]</sup> Over the next five years, Chapman built a new Arsenal. He appointed an enduring new trainer Tom Whittaker,<sup>[38]</sup> implemented Charlie Buchan's new twist on the nascent WM formation,<sup>[39][40]</sup> captured young players like Cliff Bastin and Eddie Hapgood, and lavished Highbury's income on stars like David Jack and Alex James. With record-breaking spending and gate receipts, Arsenal quickly became known as the Bank of England club.<sup>[41][42]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        Transformed, Chapman's Arsenal claimed their first national trophy, the FA Cup, in 1930, and League Championships followed in 1930–31 and 1932–33.<sup>[43]</sup> Chapman also presided over off the pitch changes: white sleeves and shirt numbers were added to the kit;<sup>[b]</sup> a Tube station was named after the club;<sup>[47][48]</sup> and the first of two opulent, Art Deco stands was completed, with some of the first floodlights in English football.<sup>[35]</sup> Suddenly, in the middle of the 1933–34 season, Chapman died of pneumonia.<sup>[49]</sup> His work was left to Joe Shaw and George Allison, who saw out a hat-trick with the 1933–34 and 1934–35 titles, and then won the 1936 FA Cup and 1937–38 title.

        World War II meant The Football League was suspended for seven years, but Arsenal returned to win it in the second post-war season, 1947–48. This was Tom Whittaker's first season as manager, after his promotion to succeed Allison, and the club had equalled the champions of England record. They won a third FA Cup in 1950, and then won a record-breaking seventh championship in 1952–53.<sup>[50]</sup> However, the war had taken its toll on Arsenal. The club had had more players killed than any top flight club,<sup>[51]</sup> and debt from reconstructing the North Bank Stand bled Arsenal's resources.<sup>[52][35]</sup>
