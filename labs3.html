            <p class="line">
                This article is about the men's football club based in England. For the women's team, see Arsenal W.F.C. For other teams called Arsenal, see Arsenal (disambiguation) § Association football.
                Herbert Chapman, who changed the fortunes of Arsenal forever, won the club its first silverware, and his legacy led the club to dominate the 1930s decade; Chapman, however, died of pneumonia in 1934, aged 55. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers;<sup>[11]</sup> he also added the white sleeves and brighter red to the club's jersey.<sup>[12]</sup> Arsène Wenger is the longest-serving manager and won the most trophies. He won a record seven FA Cups, and his title-winning team set an English record for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004,<sup>[13]</sup> receiving the nickname The Invincibles.

            <p>In 1886, munitions workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, after the destruction of their South London stadium by suffragettes, the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close neighbours of Tottenham Hotspur, and creating the North London derby. In 2006, they moved to the nearby Emirates Stadium. With an annual revenue of €388m in the 19–20 season,<sup>[14]</sup> Arsenal was estimated to be worth US$2.68 billion by Forbes, making it the world's seventh most valuable club,<sup>[15]</sup> while it is one of the most followed on social media.<sup>[16]</sup> The motto of the club has long been Victoria Concordia Crescit, Latin for "Victory Through Harmony".</p>
